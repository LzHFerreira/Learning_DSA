# Naive String Search (Brute Force) Implementation in Python
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# The naive string search algorithm (also called brute force search)
# checks for the presence of a pattern (substring) in a text by
# checking every possible position in the text where the pattern could fit.
#
# Time Complexity:
#   - Worst-case: O((n - m + 1) * m) â‰ˆ O(n * m)
#     where n = length of text, m = length of pattern
#   - Best-case: O(n) (if pattern is found at the first position)
# Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra space required)
#
# Reasoning:
#   - The algorithm slides the pattern over the text one character at a time,
#     and for each position, checks if the substring matches the pattern.
#   - It is simple to implement but inefficient for large texts or patterns.
#   - It does not preprocess the pattern or text, unlike more advanced algorithms
#     (e.g., KMP, Boyer-Moore).
#
# Example Usage Cases:
#   - Educational purposes (to teach string searching concepts)
#   - Small texts or patterns where performance is not critical
#   - Situations where simplicity is more important than speed
