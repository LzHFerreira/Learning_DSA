# Learning_DSA

This repo is going to store everything I do in my way to learn DSA. 

<b>Note</b>: My folder names may incorectly lead you believe that "My_own_code" was fully generated by me. 

Obviously, that's not the case. 

The code here is a mix of what I'm seeing in multiple courses and Copilot interactions. 

I really hope that I'm not cutting that many corners and that this doesn't come to bite me in the ass in the future, but for now, I have to choose speed. 

If case may be, I'll implement those same DSA structures with C and fuckin VIM W/O plugins in the future, whenever I'm the mood for flexing.
