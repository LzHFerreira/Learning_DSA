Changes made during refactoring:

1. Modularization:
   - Created a 'core' folder for core logic.
   - Created a 'cli' folder for CLI interaction.
   - Created a 'tests' folder for unit tests.

2. CLI Separation:
   - Moved CLI logic to 'cli/main.py'.
   - Created 'run.py' as the entry point to run the CLI.

3. Test Coverage:
   - Added unit tests in 'tests/test_hotel_message_system.py' to test the HotelMessageSystem class.
